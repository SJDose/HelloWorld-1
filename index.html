<h1> # HelloWorld </h1>
  <p> My first GitHub repository. </p>
  <p> I chose to take this class to expand the little skills I have in creating web pages for my art career. I want to eventually sell my art, and even though I can use other websites to help make websites, I want to create my own from sctratch. It feels more personal that way to the customer. I like to be the one who makes things, not to be the one that uses what someone else did. </p> 
  <p> Web page design also sounded very interesting to me, and thought it would be better and more professional than my freshman year computer apps final assignment. We had to make a website using Google, and it was too simple for my liking. I feel like this class will come with somewhat of a good challenge. :) </p>
