<h1> # HelloWorld </h1>
<p> My first GitHub repository. I chose to take this class to expand the little skills I have in creating web pages for my art career. I want to eventually sell my art, and even though I can use other websites to help make websites, I want to create my own from sctratch. It feels for personal that way to the customer. I like to be the one who makes things, not to be the one that uses what someone else did. (unfinsihed) </p>
